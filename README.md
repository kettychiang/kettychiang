Hey there, I'm Kettyâ€”great to connect with you on GitHub!

I'm a junior cyber risk analyst just starting my journey in cybersecurity. I have been studying cybersecurity, participating in CTFs and other competitions, self-learning programming, and hustling on projects during nights and weekends.ðŸ‘¾
