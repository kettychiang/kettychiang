Hey there, I'm Ketty—great to connect with you on GitHub!

👀 I'm a junior developer and cybersecurity student, hustling on projects during nights and weekends.
🌱 Currently, I'm immersed in self-learning C, JavaScript, Python, and Solidity, while also delving into the realms of AI and machine learning.
💞️ I kickstart my day with a cup of milk tea, though I'm definitely a coffee enthusiast.
📫 Feel free to swing by the community and shoot me a greeting anytime! 😊
